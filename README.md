# POE
These codes are generated for the project of parent-of-origin effects in pigs. We provide a python script to split F1 reads in the form of BAM file using tag SNPs. Its function is similar to SNPsplit. However, this python script takes the parental and offspring SNPs into consideration, and it works for heterozygous markers in offspring without the requirement of different homozygotes for parents.
